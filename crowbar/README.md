# crowbar

Sometimes you're bull on a company and want to buy some shares or calls.  

You might ask yourself the following questions:

"whats the best way for me to buy exposure to this stock/underlying?"  
"which of these options provide the most leverage?"  
"at what point are the contracts worth more than equities?"  

Basiclly you want your dollars to work as hard as they can and be as leveraged as possible and minimize the distance between the current price and your breakeven.

### Usage

```
cd crowbar 
go run src/main.go <TICKER> <BALANCE> <DISTANCE_THRESHOLD>
```
